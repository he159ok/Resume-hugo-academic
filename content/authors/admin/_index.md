Hi, everyone! My name is Jianfeng He. It is so honor to meet you all.

I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student in the CS@Virginia Tech. I research on computer vision, natural language processing. For the computer vision, I focus on guided image editing. For the natural language processing, I study on the uncertainty analysis in its applications. In addition, I worked on cross-modal retrieval when I was a master student in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
